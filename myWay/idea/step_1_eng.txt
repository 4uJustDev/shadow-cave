I ask AI "DeepSeek" for game ideas, i have some, but they are not for browser games.

I like first and second variants, so next i decide what i can realize, 
and what looks "real" for created in browser. 

I CHOOSE SECOND - Treasure Island (Shadow Cave - name of the game)

Stack: Three.js, JS, you can add anything related to Web development if necessary.

Browser game: A game where you can collect, find, and accumulate resources. Something can be improved.

Take into account:
1) It will be necessary to spend resources.
2) There is a main goal, for example, to buy the largest item.
3) There are stations that I can buy, they will make it easier for me to pass.
4) There must be obstacles, for example, stations break down and need to be repaired, so you need to monitor this and find the appropriate tools.
5) There will be achievements in the game (You need to store them somewhere, for example in the cache or you can do authorization)
6) As for authorization, I'm afraid that it won't be safe for users to register on my site.

It is necessary to write game ideas and their short description and plot outline. A game made there for 30-60 hours, 
at least basic logic and levels. Then it will be possible to improve and refine it. Write down 10 project ideas that can be done, 
it's important to me initially the idea of the game, not how I will implement it.
